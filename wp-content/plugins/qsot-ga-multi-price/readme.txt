Provides the ability to assign multiple General Admission prices to an Event Area.

== Description ==

[OpenTickets â€“ General Admission Multiple Pricing (GAMP)](http://opentickets.com/software/opentickets-general-admission-multiple-pricing/ "OpenTickets - GAMP Software Desription Page") is an extension that allows you to select multiple prices for *General Admission Events*, eg: (Adult-$10/Child-$5/Senior-$7). This extension provides pricing flexibility, which empowers the admin user to define multiple pricing levels for an event, and provides the customer with a user-friendly experience to select from multiple pricing options in one quick checkout process.

GAMP also provides you the ability to setup multiple "pricing structures" for a single event area. This means that multiple events can share a single event area, and still have different pricing options available to them, without having to recreate the event area for each event. Even an event with multiple showings, where multiple pricing structures would be needed, are possible.

Eg: Day Show Tickets Price (Adult-$10/Child-$5/Senior-$7) / Night Show Ticket Price (Adult-$15/Child-$8/Senior-$10)

Features:
* Create General Admission Tier Ticket Pricing
* Offer customers the opportunity to purchase various tickets tiers in one checkout process
* Create Multiple General Admission Tier Ticket Pricing Structures for single and recurring Events
* Easily add pricing structures to Venue Event Area

1. Have already installed WooCommerce and OpenTickets Community Edition, and set them up to your liking.

Via the WordPress Admin:

1. Login to the admin dashboard of your WordPress site.
1. Click the 'Plugins' menu item on the left sidebar, usually found somewhere near the bottom.
1. Near the top left of the loaded page, you will see an Icon, the word 'Plugins', and a button next to those, labeled 'Add New'. Click 'Add New'.
1. In the top left of this page, you will see another Icon and the words 'Install Plugins'. Directly below that are a few links, one of which is 'Upload'. Click 'Upload'.
1. On the loaded screen, below the links described in STEP #4, you will see a location to upload a file. Click the button to select the file you downloaded from [OpenTickets.com](http://opentickets.com/).
1. Once the file has been selected, click the 'Install Now' button.
    * Depending on your server setup, you may need to enter some FTP credentials, which you should have handy.

== When should you use GAMP? ==

GAMP is meant as a solution that allows you to provide multiple pricing levels to a general admission event. An example of a situation that might require this would be if you need to provide a 'Child Price', an 'Adult Price' and a 'Senior Price'.

== What GAMP does not do ==

GAMP provides the ability to offer these multiple different pricing levels, but it *does not* allow you to control the quantity of each pricing option. Thus, if you needed to offer 30 VIP tickets and 300 General Admission tickets, GAMP does not cover this situation. For this situation, you may consider our [Seating Extension](http://stage.opentickets.com/software/opentickets-seating/), as it not only provides granular control of pricing options, but it also allows you to define how many are available.
